Reduct is a functional, immutable, and S-expression based configuration and scripting language. It aims to provide a flexible, simple, efficient and Turing complete way to store and manipulate hierarchical data, all as a freestanding C99 header-only library.

## First Steps

Reduct should be familiar to anyone used to Lisp or functional languages, but it is intended to be easy to learn even for those who aren't.

All expressions in Reduct are either atoms or lists of atoms, and the process of evaluating expressions ought to be thought of as reducing these expressions into a simpler form. Much like how mathematical expressions are reduced to their final values.

For example, the following Reduct expression:

```lisp
(+ 1 2)
(* 3 4)
```

Will evaluate to `(3 12)`. Note how the result of the evaluation is a list containing the results of each top-level expression.

### Hello World

An obvious way to write "Hello World" in Reduct might look like:

```lisp
(println! "Hello, World!")
```

However, it could be even simpler. We could simply write:

```lisp
"Hello, World!"
```

Which will, of course, evaluate to `Hello, World!`.

### Complex Example

Finally, included is a slightly more complex example:

```lisp
(do
    (def fib (lambda (n) 
        (if (<= n 1)
            n
            (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))
        )
    ))

    (format "Fibonacci of 35 is {}" (fib 35))
)
```

For more examples, see the `bench/` and `tests/` directories.

## Style Guide

There is no strictly enforced style guide, however, here are some recommendations.

### Indentation

Use 4-space indentation.

### Parentheses

If a list spans multiple lines, the closing parentheses should be on its own line, aligned with the opening parentheses. If a list is not spanned across multiple lines, the closing parentheses should be on the same line as the last item.

> The argument for placing parentheses on their own lines, braking with Lisp tradition, is to allow for multiline lists to be easily copy, pasted and cut,

For example:

```lisp
(def fib (lambda (n) 
    (if (<= n 1)
        n
        (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))
    )
))
```

### Naming

Use `kebab-case` for variable and function names.

```lisp
(def my-variable 10)

(def my-function (lambda (x y)
    (+ x y)
)) 
```

## Tools

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

A simple CLI tool is provided to evaluate Reduct files or expressions directly from the terminal.

```bash
reduct my_file.reduct
reduct -e "(+ 1 2 3)"
reduct -d my_file.reduct # output the compiled bytecode
reduct -s my_file.reduct # silent mode, wont output the result of the evaluation
```

#### Setup

The CLI tool can be found at `tools/reduct-cli/` and uses CMake. To build the tool write:

```bash
cd tools/reduct-cli
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

To install the tool write:

```bash
cmake --install build # if that fails: sudo cmake --install build
```

### Visual Studio Code

A syntax highlighting extension for Visual Studio Code can be found at `tools/reduct-vscode/`.

#### Setup

The extension is not yet available in the marketplace.

As such, to install it, copy the `tools/reduct-vscode/` directory to `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\` if you're on Windows or `~/.vscode/extensions/` if you're on macOS/Linux.

Finally, restart Visual Studio Code.

## C API

Included is an example of using Reduct as a single header without linking:

```c
// my_file.c

#define REDUCT_INLINE
#include "reduct.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char buffer[0x10000];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{    
    reduct_t* reduct = NULL;

    reduct_error_t error = REDUCT_ERROR();
    if (REDUCT_ERROR_CATCH(&error))
    {
        reduct_error_print(&error, stderr);
        reduct_free(reduct);
        return 1;
    }

    reduct = reduct_new(&error);

    reduct_handle_t ast = reduct_parse_file(reduct, "my_file.reduct");

    reduct_stdlib_register(reduct, REDUCT_STDLIB_ALL);

    reduct_function_t* function = reduct_compile(reduct, &ast);

    reduct_handle_t result = reduct_eval(reduct, function);
    reduct_stringify(reduct, &result, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("%s\n", buffer);

    reduct_free(reduct);
    return 0;
}
```

Included is another example of using Reduct with linking where an additional implementation file is used to build the Reduct parser and evaluator:

```c
// my_file.c

#include "reduct.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char buffer[0x10000];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    /// Same as above...
}
```

```c
// my_reduct.c

#define REDUCT_IMPL
#include "reduct.h"
```

### C Natives

Reduct allows for the registration of C functions as "natives" that can be called from within Reduct.

To register a native function, use the `reduct_native_register` function:

```c
reduct_handle_t my_native(reduct_t* reduct, reduct_size_t argc, reduct_handle_t* argv)
{
    // ...
    return reduct_handle_nil(reduct);
}

// ...

reduct_native_t natives[] = {
    {"my-native", my_native},
};
reduct_native_register(reduct, natives, sizeof(natives) / sizeof(reduct_native_t));
```

All Reduct standard library functions are available in C, for example, `reduct_is_atom()`, `reduct_assoc()`, etc.

## Implementation

Reduct is implemented as a register-based bytecode language, where the Reduct source is first parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then compiled into a custom bytecode format before being executed by the virtual machine/evaluator.

> Note that the "Abstract Syntax Tree" is just a Reduct expression, lists and atoms, meaning that the compiler is itself written to operate on the same data structures as the evaluator produces.

The bytecode format itself is a stream of 32bit instructions, with all instructions able to read/write to an array of registers, or read from an array of constants.

*See [inst.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/inst.h) for more information on instructions.*

Since Reduct is immutable, the constants array is also used for "captured" values from outer scopes (closures) and we can also allow the compiler to fold constant expressions at compile-time, far more than would normally be possible.

*See [compile.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/compile.h) for more information on the compiler.*

To improve caching and reduce pointer indirection, Reduct uses "handles" (`reduct_handle_t`) which are [Tagged Pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer) using NaN boxing to allow a single 64bit value to store either a 48 bit signed integer, IEEE 754 double or a pointer to a heap allocated item.

*See [handle.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/handle.h) for more information on handles.*

Items (`reduct_item_t`) represent all heap allocated objects, such as lists, atoms and closures. All items are exactly 64 bytes in size and allocated using a custom pool allocator and freed using a garbage collector and free list.

Since Reduct uses its handles to store most integers and floats, it can avoid heap allocations for many common values, significantly reducing the pressure on the garbage collector and improving caching.

*See [item.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/item.h) for more information on items.*

Lists are implemented as a "bit-mapped vector trie", providing $O(log_{w} n)$ access, insertion, and deletion, where $O(log_{w} n)$ is the width of each node in the trie.

*See [list.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/list.h) for more information on lists.*

All atoms use [String Interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning), meaning that every unique atom is only stored once in memory. This makes any string comparison into a single pointer comparison, and it means that parsing the integer/floating point value of an atom or an items truthiness only needs to be done once.

*See [atom.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/atom.h) for more information on atoms.*

Many additional optimization techniques are used, for example, [Computed Gotos](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/07/12/computed-goto-for-efficient-dispatch-tables), [setjmp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/longjmp.3.html) based error handling to avoid excessive error checking in the hot path, [Tail Call Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) and much more.

*See [eval.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/eval.h) for more information on the evaluator.*

## Grammar

The grammar of Reduct is designed to be as straight forward as possible, the full grammar using [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) can be found below.

```ebnf
file = { expression | comment } ;
expression = item | infix | white_space ;
item = list | atom ;

infix =  "{", { expression }, "}" ;

list = "(", { expression }, ")" ;

atom = unquoted_atom | quoted_atom ;
unquoted_atom = ( character, { character } ) ;
quoted_atom = '"', { character | white_space | escape_sequence }, '"' ;

comment = line_comment | block_comment ;
line_comment = "//", { character | " " | "\t" }, [ "\n" | "\r" ] ;
block_comment = "/*", { character | white_space }, "*/" ;

white_space = " " | "\t" | "\n" | "\r" ;
escape_sequence = "\\", ( "a" | "b" | "e" | "f" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "v" | "\\" | "'" | '"' | "?" | ( "x", hex, hex ) ) ;

character = letter | digit | symbol ;

symbol = sign | "!" | "$" | "%" | "&" | "*" | "." | "/" | ":" | "<" | "=" | ">" | "?" | "@" | "^" | "_" | "|" | "~" | "{" | "}" | "[" | "]" | "#" | "," | ";" | "`" ;
sign = "+" | "-" ;

hex = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" ;
digit = octal | "8" | "9" ;
octal = binary | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" ;
binary = "0" | "1" ;

letter = upper_case | lower_case ;
upper_case = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"| "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"| "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;
lower_case = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n"| "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u"| "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
```

> Note the difference between the terms "item" and "expression", the term "item" will be used to refer to the in memory structure while a "expression" refers to the textual representation of an item. Meaning that an expression evaluates to an item.

Included is a list of the final value for each escape sequence:

| Escape Sequence | Description | Final Value |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `\a` | Alert (bell) | `0x07` |
| `\b` | Backspace | `0x08` |
| `\e` | Escape | `0x1B` |
| `\f` | Formfeed | `0x0C` |
| `\n` | Newline | `0x0A` |
| `\r` | Carriage Return | `0x0D` |
| `\t` | Horizontal Tab | `0x09` |
| `\v` | Vertical Tab | `0x0B` |
| `\\` | Backslash | `\` |
| `\'` | Single Quote | `'` |
| `\"` | Double Quote | `"` |
| `\?` | Question Mark | `?` |
| `\xHH` | Hexadecimal value | `0xHH` |

## Infix Expressions

Infix expressions provide a more convenient way to write certain expressions, particularly mathematical or logical expressions.

To write an infix expression, use curly braces:

```lisp
{1 + 2 * 3} // (1 + (2 * 3))
{2 * (my-func1 1 2)} // (2 * (my-func 1 2))
{not (my-func2 data) or {count > 10}} // (or (not (my-func2 data)) (> count 10))
```

When the parser encounters an infix expression it will expand it into a normal expression, using the following rules:

1. Operators are grouped based on their precedence. For example, `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`.
2. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.
3. If an expression is wrapped in another infix expression, it is treated as a single unit and its precedence is ignored (e.g., `{{1 + 2} * 3}`).
4. Lists within an infix expression are treated as usual.
5. If an infix expression contains only a single item, it is treated as that item (e.g., `{1}` becomes `1`).

The following table lists the supported operators:

| Precedence | Operators |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | `not`, unary `-` |
| 6 | `*`, `/`, `%` |
| 5 | `+`, `-` |
| 4 | `<<`, `>>` |
| 3 | `&`, `\|`, `^` |
| 2 | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` |
| 1 | `and` |
| 0 | `or` |

## Evaluation

A parsed Reduct expression can optionally be evaluated. This means that everything described below is an optional extension
of the language, not a core part of it, and should be considered as such. This can be quite convenient as it allows Reduct to be utilized as a simple and efficient markup language similar to JSON or XML.

Evaluation is the process of recursively reducing an expression to its simplest form in a depth-first, left-to-right
manner.

### Callables

There are three callable types, intrinsics, natives and lambdas. Lambdas are defined in Reduct, natives are defined in C and intrinsics are handled by the bytecode compiler.

```ebnf
callable = unquoted_atom | lambda ;
```

### Atoms

There are no integers, floats or similar within Reduct, only atoms with different "shapes".

An atom can be either string-shaped, integer-shaped or float-shaped, for convenience an atom that is integer-shaped or float-shaped is also considered number-shaped.

```ebnf
string = quoted_atom ;

number = integer | float ;
integer = decimal_integer | hex_integer | octal_integer | binary_integer ;

decimal_integer = [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit } ;
hex_integer = [ sign ], "0", ( "x" | "X" ), hex, { [ "_" ], hex } ;
octal_integer = [ sign ], "0", ( "o" | "O" ), octal, { [ "_" ], octal } ;
binary_integer = [ sign ], "0", ( "b" | "B" ), binary, { [ "_" ], binary } ;

float = float_number | float_naked_decimal | float_trailing_decimal | scientific_number | special_float ;

float_number = [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit }, ".", digit, { [ "_" ], digit }, [ ( "e" | "E" ), [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit } ] ;
float_naked_decimal = [ sign ], ".", digit, { [ "_" ], digit }, [ ( "e" | "E" ), [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit } ] ;
float_trailing_decimal = [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit }, ".", [ ( "e" | "E" ), [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit } ] ;
scientific_number = [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit }, ( "e" | "E" ), [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit } ;
special_float = ( [ sign ], ( "i" | "I" ), ( "n" | "N" ), ( "f" | "F" ) ) | ( ( "n" | "N" ), ( "a" | "A" ), ( "n" | "N" ) ) ;
```

All mathematical operations on integer-shaped or float-shaped atoms follow C semantics.

#### Type Coercion

For any math intrinsic that takes in multiple arguments, C-like type promotion rules are used.

This means that if any of the atoms provided to the operation are float-shaped, the others will also be converted to floats. Otherwise, they will be converted to integers.

If one or more of the atoms are neither integer-shaped nor float-shaped, the evaluation will fail.

### Lists

During the evaluation of a list, the first item is immediately evaluated and if it evaluates to a callable item, it will be executed with the remaining items in the list as its arguments and with the list being replaced by the result of the evaluation.

Certain primitives may not evaluate all items within the list, for example, the `or` intrinsic will stop evaluating on the first truthy item. Most primitives, such as `+`, will evaluate all items.

### Truthiness

The following grammar defines truthy and falsy items:

```ebnf
truthy = true | expression - falsy_item ;
falsy  = falsy_list | falsy_atom | zero ;

falsy_list = nil ;
falsy_atom = '""' | false ;

true = "1" ;
false = "0" ;

nil = "(", { white_space }, ")" ;

zero = decimal_zero | hex_zero | octal_zero | binary_zero ;
decimal_zero = [ sign ], "0", { [ "_" ], "0" }, [ ".", { [ "_" ], "0" } ], [ ( "e" | "E" ), [ sign ], digit, { [ "_" ], digit } ] ;
hex_zero     = [ sign ], "0", ( "x" | "X" ), "0", { [ "_" ], "0" } ;
octal_zero   = [ sign ], "0", ( "o" | "O" ), "0", { [ "_" ], "0" } ;
binary_zero  = [ sign ], "0", ( "b" | "B" ), "0", { [ "_" ], "0" } ;
```

### Ordering

Reduct defines a total ordering for all possible items. This is used by comparison primitives like `<` or `sort`.

The ordering of types is defined as

```plaintext
number < string < list
```

#### Ordering Rules

- **number:** Compared by value, a greater value is considered larger. If both values are equal, but one is float-shaped and the other is integer-shaped, the float-shaped atom is considered larger.
- **string:** Compared lexicographically by their ASCII characters (e.g., `"apple" < "banana"`), or by their length if one is a prefix of the other (e.g., `"apple" < "apples"`).
- **list:** Compared item by item. A list is considered "less than" another if its first non-equal item is lesser than the other list's first non-equal item (e.g., `(1 2) < (1 3)`), or by their length if one is a prefix of the other (e.g., `(1 2) < (1 2 3)`).

### Variables

Variables are used to store and retrieve items within a Reduct environment. Variables are defined using the `def`
intrinsic and can be accessed using their names.

As an example, variables can be used to create a more traditional "function definition" by defining a variable as a lambda:

```lisp
(def add (lambda (a b) (+ a b)))

(add 1 2) // Evaluates to "3"
```

### Lexical Scoping

Reduct uses lexical scoping. This means that a function or expression can access variables from the scope in which it was defined, as well as any parent scopes. When a variable is defined using `def`, it is added to the current local scope. If a variable is accessed, the evaluator searches for the name starting from the innermost scope and moving outwards to the global scope.

When a lambda is executed, it creates a new scope where its arguments are bound to the provided values. This scope is destroyed once the lambda finishes evaluation, ensuring that local variables do not leak into the outer environment.

### Default Constants

The following constants are defined by default in the Reduct environment:

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `true`   | `1` |
| `false`  | `0` |
| `nil`    | `()` |
| `pi`     | `3.14159265358979323846` |
| `e`      | `2.7182818284590452354` |

### Intrinsics

#### Core & Evaluation

**`(quote <expression>) -> <expression>`**

Returns the provided expression without evaluating it.

**`(list {expression} ) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list containing the results of evaluating each expression.

**`(do <expression> {expression}) -> <item>`**

Evaluates each expression in sequence and returns the result of the last one.

**`(lambda ( {arg: atom} ) <expression> {expression} ) -> <lambda>`**

Returns a user-defined anonymous function. When called, the body expressions are evaluated in sequence, and the result of the last expression is returned.

**`(-> <initial: expression> {step: expression}) -> <item>**`

Returns a threaded expression, where the result of each expression is passed as the first argument to the next.

**`(def <name: atom> <value: item>) -> <value: item>`**
  
Defines a variable with the given name and value within the current scope.

Note that there is no `let` intrinsic in Reduct, this is becouse using `def` within a `do` block acomplishes the same result as a `let` expression in other Lisps, while also avoiding additional indentation and visual seperation which hurts readability.

For example:

```lisp
(do
    (def x 10)
    (def y 20)
    (+ x y)
) // Evaluates to "30"

(let ((x 10) (y 20))
    (+ x y)
) // Evaluates to "30"
```

---

#### Control Flow & Logic

**`(if <cond: item> <then: item> [else: item]) -> <item>`**

Evaluates `<then>` if `<cond>` is truthy, otherwise evaluates `<else>` if provided, otherwise returns `nil`.

**`(when <cond: item> {body: item}) -> <item>`**

Evaluates each `<body>` expression in sequence if `<cond>` is truthy, returning the result of the last expression, or `nil` if the condition is falsy.

**`(unless <cond: item> {body: item}) -> <item>`**

Evaluates each `<body>` expression in sequence if `<cond>` is falsy, returning the result of the last expression, or `nil` if the condition is truthy.

**`(cond ( <cond: item> <val: item> ) { ( <cond: item> <val: item> ) }) -> <item>`**

Evaluates each condition in order, returning the value associated with the first truthy condition, or `nil` if none are truthy.

**`(match <target: item> ( <val: item> <res: item> ) { ( <val: item> <res: item> ) }  <default: item>) -> <item>`**

Evaluates the target, then compares it against each case value. Returns the result of the first matching case.

**`(and <item> {item}) -> <item>`**

Evaluates arguments left-to-right, returning the last truthy value, or the first falsy value if any are falsy. Will stop evaluating arguments as soon as one is falsy.

**`(or <item> {item}) -> <item>`**

Evaluates arguments left-to-right, returning the first truthy value, or the last falsy value if all are falsy. Will stop evaluating arguments as soon as one is truthy.

**`(not <item>) -> <true|false>`**

Returns `true` if the argument is falsy, otherwise `false`.

---

#### Binary Operators

**`(+ <number> {number}) -> <number>`**

### Standard Library

Since Reduct is a functional language, side effects should be avoided when possible. As such, any native with side effects will be suffixed with an exclamation mark `!`.

#### Error Handling

**`(assert! <cond: item> <msg: item>) -> <cond: item>`**

Evaluates `<cond>`. If it is falsy, the evaluation fails and throws an error with `<msg>` as the message.

**`(throw! <msg: atom>)`**

Throws an error with the given atom being the error message.

**`(try <callable> <catch: lambda>) -> <item>`**

Calls the provided callable. If an error occurs during evaluation, the `<catch>` lambda is executed with the error message as its argument. Otherwise, returns the result of the callable.

---

#### Higher-Order Functions

**`(map <list> <callable>) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list by applying `<callable>` to each item in `<list>`. The `<callable>` must accept a single argument.

**`(filter <list> <callable>) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list containing only items from `<list>` for which `<callable>` returns a truthy value. The `<callable>` must accept a single argument.

**`(reduce <list> [initial: item] <callable>) -> <item>`**

Reduces `<list>` to a single value. The `<callable>` must accept two arguments: the `accumulator` (which starts as `[initial]` or the first item of `<list>` in which case the first item is skipped) and the current `item`, and it should return the new accumulator value.

**`(apply <list> <callable>) -> <item>`**

Calls the callable with the items within the list as its arguments.

**`(any? <list> [callable]) -> <true|false>`**

Returns `true` if any item in the list satisfies the provided `callable` (or is truthy if no callable is provided), otherwise `false`.

**`(all? <list> [callable]) -> <true|false>`**

Returns `true` if all items in the list satisfy the provided `callable` (or are truthy if no callable is provided), otherwise `false`.

**`(sort <list> [callable]) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list containing the sorted items of the list. The sort is guaranteed to be stable.

If a `callable` is provided, it should accept two arguments and return a truthy value if the first argument should appear before the second.

If no `callable` is specified, then items are sorted in ascending order.
