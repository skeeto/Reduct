Reduct is a functional, immutable, S-expression based configuration and scripting language. It aims to combine the flexibility of a Lisp with the ease-of-use and performance of a language like Lua. All within a C99 header-only library.

## Tools

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

A simple CLI tool is provided to evaluate Reduct files or expressions directly from the terminal.

```bash
reduct my_file.rdt
reduct -e "(+ 1 2 3)"
reduct -d my_file.rdt # output the compiled bytecode
reduct -s my_file.rdt # silent mode, wont output the result of the evaluation
```

#### Setup

You can download pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows from the [Releases](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/releases) page.

Alternatively, you can build it from source:

```bash
cd tools/reduct-cli
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

To install the tool write:

```bash
cmake --install build # if that fails: sudo cmake --install build
```

### Visual Studio Code

A syntax highlighting extension for Visual Studio Code can be found at `tools/reduct-vscode/`.

#### Setup

The extension can be found on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KaiNorberg.reduct).

Alternatively, to install it manually, copy the `tools/reduct-vscode/` directory to `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\` if you're on Windows or `~/.vscode/extensions/` if you're on macOS/Linux.

Finally, restart Visual Studio Code.

## Introduction

Within Reduct, all expressions are either atoms or lists, where an atom is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of expressions enclosed in parentheses.

For example:

```lisp
("atom1" atom2 3.14 (4atom 5678)) // A list containing three atoms and a list.
```

The tree structure that this creates is called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and for some use cases, that will be enough.

The evaluation of an AST is an optional part of the language.

### Evaluation

Evaluation is the process of recursively reducing an AST into another, simpler, AST, much like how mathematical expressions are reduced to their final values.

For example:

```lisp
(+ 1 2) // Evaluates to "3"
(* 3 4) // Evaluates to "12"
```

> Note how the top level expression is implicitly a `do` block, with the last evaluation being returned.

### Atoms

Atoms are the most basic building blocks of Reduct. They are sequences of characters (strings) that can represent text, numbers, or symbols.

```lisp
"This is a string atom"
12345 // An integer-shaped atom
3.14159 // A float-shaped atom
my-variable // A symbol-shaped atom
```

There are no explicit integers or floats within Reduct, only atoms with different "shapes".

An atom can be either string-shaped, integer-shaped or float-shaped, for convenience an atom that is integer-shaped or float-shaped is also considered number-shaped.

### Callables

There are three callable types: intrinsics, natives, and lambdas. Lambdas are defined in Reduct, natives are defined in C, and intrinsics are handled by the bytecode compiler.

```lisp
(lambda (n) (* n n)) // A lambda that squares its argument.
```

To call a callable, use it as the first item in a list:

```lisp
((lambda (n) (* n n)) 5) // Evaluates to "25"
```

### Hello World

We should now know enough to write a basic "Hello World" script.

An obvious way to write "Hello World" in Reduct might look like:

```lisp
(println! "Hello, World!")
```

However, since Reduct is all about reduction, it could be even simpler. We could simply write:

```lisp
"Hello, World!"
```

Which will, of course, evaluate to `Hello, World!`.

For more examples, see the `bench/` and `tests/` directories.

## Motivation

Reduct aims to provide a series of potential advantages that over existing languages.

### Performance

Reduct is designed to be fast and efficient, utilizing a register-based VM and many other techniques to improve performance, allowing it to outperform even Lua (though not the JIT version obviously, maybe one day...), in some benchmarks.

See [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) for more information.

### Lisps and Readability

Lisps, which Reduct takes heavy inspiration from, are generally agreed to be a very powerful style of language and yet are frequently criticized for their poor readability.

The most often blamed source of this poor readability is the sheer volume of parentheses.

Reduct makes the argument that most of these complaints are due to nesting, not parentheses; that it can be solved via infix notation, banning `let` and a more modern style guide.

Included are three examples of a basic program written in common Lisp C, and Reduct.

#### Lisp

```lisp
(let ((x 10)
      (y 20))
  (let ((z (+ x y)))
    (* z 2)))
```

#### C

```c
int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    int z = x + y;
    return z * 2;
}
```

#### Reduct

```lisp
(do
    (def x 10)
    (def y 20)
    (def z {x + y})
    {z * 2}
)
```

Note how in Reduct the use of curly braces for infix notation and the `def` intrinsic for scoped definitions allows for a more familiar, imperative-like structure while remaining entirely functional, and S-expression based.

### Flexibility

Since code and data are represented using the same structures, Reduct can be used for practically anything.

One of Reducts original intended use cases was for a C UI library, where it would act as both the markup and scripting language, almost like a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Included is an example of what that might look like:

```lisp
(def my-color (lambda ()
    (if {(uptime!) % 1000 < 500}
        "red"
        "blue"
    )
))  

("button"
    ("label" "Click me!")
    ("on-click" (lambda () (println! "Button clicked!")))
    ("style" (
        ("color" (my-color))
        ("width" 100)
        ("height" 50)
    ))
)
```

Despite that original use case, Reduct can just as easily be utilized for scripting, configuration, or even as a general-purpose embedded language.

## Additional Concepts

### Type Coercion

For any math intrinsic that takes in multiple arguments, C-like type promotion rules are used.

This means that if any of the atoms provided to the operation are float-shaped, the others will also be converted to floats. Otherwise, they will be converted to integers.

If one or more of the atoms are neither integer-shaped nor float-shaped, the evaluation will fail.

For example:

```lisp
(+ 1 2.5) // Evaluates to "3.5"
(* 2 3) // Evaluates to "6"
(/ 10 3) // Evaluates to "3"
(/ 10 3.0) // Evaluates to "3.333333"
```

### Truthiness

A truthy item is any item that is not falsy. Falsy items include `nil` (an empty list), an empty atom, the constant `false` (which evaluates to `0`), or any number-shaped atom that evaluates to zero.

For example:

```lisp
(if () "truthy" "falsy") // Evaluates to "falsy"
(if 0 "truthy" "falsy") // Evaluates to "falsy"
(if "" "truthy" "falsy") // Evaluates to "falsy"
(if 1 "truthy" "falsy") // Evaluates to "truthy"
(if false "truthy" "falsy") // Evaluates to "falsy"
(if true "truthy" "falsy") // Evaluates to "truthy"
```

### Ordering

Reduct defines a total ordering for all possible items. This is used by comparison primitives like `<` or `sort`.

The ordering of types is defined as:

```plaintext
number < string < list
```

The following rules apply:

- **number:** Compared by value, a greater value is considered larger. If both values are equal, but one is float-shaped and the other is integer-shaped, the float-shaped atom is considered larger.
- **string:** Compared lexicographically by their ASCII characters, or by their length if one is a prefix of the other.
- **list:** Compared item by item. A list is considered "less than" another if its first non-equal item is lesser than the other list's first non-equal item, or by their length if one is a prefix of the other.

For example, all following expressions are true:

```lisp
(< 1 2)
(< 1 2.5)
(< "apple" "banana")
(< "apple" "apples")
(< (1 2) (1 3))
(< (1 2) (1 2 3))
```

### Variables

Variables are defined using the `def` intrinsic and can be accessed using their names. Just like everything else, variables are immutable and as such there is no `set` or similar intrinsic.

As an example, variables can be used to create a more traditional "function definition" by defining a variable as a lambda:

```lisp
(def add (lambda (a b) (+ a b)))

(add 1 2) // Evaluates to "3"
```

### Infix Expressions

Infix expressions provide a more convenient way to write certain expressions, particularly mathematical or logical expressions.

To write an infix expression, use curly braces:

```lisp
{1 + 2 * 3} // (1 + (2 * 3))
{2 * (my-func1 1 2)} // (2 * (my-func 1 2))
{not (my-func2 data) or {count > 10}} // (or (not (my-func2 data)) (> count 10))
```

When the parser encounters an infix expression it will expand it into a normal expression, using the following rules:

1. Operators are grouped based on their precedence. For example, `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`.
2. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.
3. If an expression is wrapped in another infix expression, it is treated as a single unit and its precedence is ignored (e.g., `{{1 + 2} * 3}`).
4. Lists within an infix expression are treated as usual.
5. If an infix expression contains only a single item, it is treated as that item (e.g., `{1}` becomes `1`).

The following table lists the supported operators:

| Precedence | Operators |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | `not`, unary `-` |
| 6 | `*`, `/`, `%` |
| 5 | `+`, `-` |
| 4 | `<<`, `>>` |
| 3 | `&`, `\|`, `^` |
| 2 | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` |
| 1 | `and` |
| 0 | `or` |

## Style Guide

There is no strictly enforced style guide, however, here are some recommendations.

### Indentation

Use 4-space indentation.

### Parentheses

If a list spans multiple lines, the closing parentheses should be on its own line, aligned with the opening parentheses. If a list is not spanned across multiple lines, the closing parentheses should be on the same line as the last item.

> The argument for placing parentheses on their own lines, breaking with Lisp tradition, is to allow for multiline lists to be easily copy, pasted and cut,

For example:

```lisp
(def fib (lambda (n) 
    (if (<= n 1)
        n
        (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))
    )
))
```

### Naming

Use `kebab-case` for variable and function names.

```lisp
(def my-variable 10)

(def my-function (lambda (x y)
    (+ x y)
)) 
```

## C API

Included is an example of using Reduct as a single header without linking:

```c
// my_file.c

#define REDUCT_INLINE
#include "reduct.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char buffer[0x10000];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{    
    reduct_t* reduct = NULL;

    reduct_error_t error = REDUCT_ERROR();
    if (REDUCT_ERROR_CATCH(&error)) // Setup setjmp.h based error handler.
    {
        // We will return to here if an error occurs.
        reduct_error_print(&error, stderr);
        reduct_free(reduct);
        return 1;
    }

    reduct = reduct_new(&error);

    reduct_stdlib_register(reduct, REDUCT_STDLIB_ALL);

    reduct_handle_t result = reduct_eval_file(reduct, "my_file.rdt");

    reduct_stringify(reduct, &result, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("%s\n", buffer);

    reduct_free(reduct);
    return 0;
}
```

Included is another example of using Reduct with linking where an additional implementation file is used to build the Reduct parser and evaluator:

```c
// my_file.c

#include "reduct.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char buffer[0x10000];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    /// Same as above...
}
```

```c
// my_reduct.c

#define REDUCT_IMPL
#include "reduct.h"
```

### C Natives

Reduct allows for the registration of C functions as "natives" that can be called from within Reduct.

To register a native function, use the `reduct_native_register` function:

```c
reduct_handle_t my_native(reduct_t* reduct, reduct_size_t argc, reduct_handle_t* argv)
{
    // ...
    return reduct_handle_nil(reduct);
}

// ...

reduct_native_t natives[] = {
    {"my-native", my_native},
};
reduct_native_register(reduct, natives, sizeof(natives) / sizeof(reduct_native_t));
```

All Reduct standard library functions are available in C, for example, `reduct_is_atom()`, `reduct_assoc()`, etc.

### Documentation

For more information, either consult the doxygen documentation within the headers or the generated documentation found [here](https://kainorberg.github.io/Reduct//html/index.html).

## Implementation

Reduct is implemented as a register-based bytecode language, where the Reduct source is first parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then compiled into a custom bytecode format before being executed by the virtual machine/evaluator.

> Note that the "Abstract Syntax Tree" is just a Reduct expression, lists and atoms, meaning that the compiler is itself written to operate on the same data structures as the evaluator produces.

The bytecode format itself is a stream of 32bit instructions, with all instructions able to read/write to an array of registers, or read from an array of constants.

*See [inst.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/inst.h) for more information on instructions.*

Since Reduct is immutable, the constants array is also used for "captured" values from outer scopes (closures) and we can also allow the compiler to fold constant expressions at compile-time, far more than would normally be possible.

*See [compile.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/compile.h) for more information on the compiler.*

To improve caching and reduce pointer indirection, Reduct uses "handles" (`reduct_handle_t`) which are [Tagged Pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer) using NaN boxing to allow a single 64bit value to store either a 48 bit signed integer, IEEE 754 double or a pointer to a heap allocated item.

*See [handle.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/handle.h) for more information on handles.*

Items (`reduct_item_t`) represent all heap allocated objects, such as lists, atoms and closures. All items are exactly 64 bytes in size and allocated using a custom pool allocator and freed using a garbage collector and free list.

Since Reduct uses its handles to store most integers and floats, it can avoid heap allocations for many common values, significantly reducing the pressure on the garbage collector and improving caching.

*See [item.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/item.h) for more information on items.*

Lists are implemented as a "bit-mapped vector trie", providing $O(log_{w} n)$ access, insertion, and deletion, where $w$ is the width of each node in the trie.

*See [list.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/list.h) for more information on lists.*

All atoms use [String Interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning), meaning that every unique atom is only stored once in memory. This makes any string comparison into a single pointer comparison, and it means that parsing the integer/floating point value of an atom or an items truthiness only needs to be done once.

*See [atom.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/atom.h) for more information on atoms.*

Many additional optimization techniques are used, for example, [Computed Gotos](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/07/12/computed-goto-for-efficient-dispatch-tables), [setjmp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/longjmp.3.html) based error handling to avoid excessive error checking in the hot path, [Tail Call Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) and much more.

*See [eval.h](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/reduct/eval.h) for more information on the evaluator.*

## Testing

Testing is done via the `tests/run_tests.sh` script, which is ran via [github actions](https://github.com/KaiNorberg/Reduct/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml) on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS.

The script will compile the CLI tool with clang `-fsanitize=address,undefined`, run a set of test scripts found in `tests/` and then use libfuzzer to fuzz the parser, compiler and evaluator.

In addition to the test script, the code base heavily uses assertions to, hopefully, catch any potential bugs or regressions.

### Intrinsics

#### Core & Evaluation

**`(quote <expression>) -> <expression>`**

Returns the provided expression without evaluating it.

**`(list {expression} ) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list containing the results of evaluating each expression.

**`(do <expression> {expression}) -> <item>`**

Evaluates each expression in sequence and returns the result of the last one.

**`(lambda ( {arg: atom} ) <expression> {expression} ) -> <lambda>`**

Returns a user-defined anonymous function. When called, the body expressions are evaluated in sequence, and the result of the last expression is returned.

**`(-> <initial: expression> {step: expression}) -> <item>`**

Returns a threaded expression, where the result of each expression is passed as the first argument to the next.

**`(def <name: atom> <value: item>) -> <value: item>`**
  
Defines a variable with the given name and value within the current scope.

Note that there is no `let` intrinsic in Reduct, this is because using `def` within a `do` block accomplishes the same result as a `let` expression in other Lisps:

For example:

```lisp
(do
    (def x 10)
    (def y 20)
    (+ x y)
) // Evaluates to "30"

(let ((x 10) (y 20))
    (+ x y)
) // Evaluates to "30"
```

### Standard Library

Since Reduct is a functional language, side effects should be avoided when possible. As such, any native with side effects will be suffixed with an exclamation mark `!`.

#### Error Handling

**`(assert! <cond: item> <msg: item>) -> <cond: item>`**

Evaluates `<cond>`. If it is falsy, the evaluation fails and throws an error with `<msg>` as the message.

**`(throw! <msg: atom>)`**

Throws an error with the given atom being the error message.

**`(try <callable> <catch: lambda>) -> <item>`**

Calls the provided callable. If an error occurs during evaluation, the `<catch>` lambda is executed with the error message as its argument. Otherwise, returns the result of the callable.

---

#### Higher-Order Functions

**`(map <list> <callable>) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list by applying `<callable>` to each item in `<list>`. The `<callable>` must accept a single argument.

**`(filter <list> <callable>) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list containing only items from `<list>` for which `<callable>` returns a truthy value. The `<callable>` must accept a single argument.

**`(reduce <list> [initial: item] <callable>) -> <item>`**

Reduces `<list>` to a single value. The `<callable>` must accept two arguments: the `accumulator` (which starts as `[initial]` or the first item of `<list>` in which case the first item is skipped) and the current `item`, and it should return the new accumulator value.

**`(apply <list> <callable>) -> <item>`**

Calls the callable with the items within the list as its arguments.

**`(any? <list> [callable]) -> <true|false>`**

Returns `true` if any item in the list satisfies the provided `callable` (or is truthy if no callable is provided), otherwise `false`.

**`(all? <list> [callable]) -> <true|false>`**

Returns `true` if all items in the list satisfy the provided `callable` (or are truthy if no callable is provided), otherwise `false`.

**`(sort <list> [callable]) -> <list>`**

Returns a new list containing the sorted items of the list. The sort is guaranteed to be stable.

If a `callable` is provided, it should accept two arguments and return a truthy value if the first argument should appear before the second.

If no `callable` is specified, then items are sorted in ascending order.

---
